# RAG From Scratch

A comprehensive implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system from scratch using Python. This project demonstrates how to build and understand RAG systems step by step through interactive Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several Jupyter notebooks, each covering different aspects of RAG implementation:

- `rag_from_scratch_1_to_4.ipynb`: Introduction and foundational concepts
- `rag_from_scratch_5_to_9.ipynb`: Core RAG components and basic implementation
- `rag_from_scratch_10_and_11.ipynb`: Advanced retrieval techniques
- `rag_from_scratch_12_to_14.ipynb`: Generation and model integration
- `rag_from_scratch_15_to_18.ipynb`: Advanced topics and optimizations

## Topics Covered

- Building embeddings and vector stores
- Implementing efficient retrieval mechanisms
- Integrating LLMs for generation
- Optimizing RAG performance
- Evaluation and testing of RAG systems
